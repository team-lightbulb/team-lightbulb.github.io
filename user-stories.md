### User Stories




* As an entrepreneur I would use this app for many reasons. The first reason that 
I would use this app would be as a resource in finding information. I would be 
able to post issues that I am having in certain fields of developing my
product or company. Here I would find solutions from my peers that
have already been on the same journey as me. Being able to 
connect with other users may also be a potential networking opportunity for me.


* As a user of this application I would be able to help others. I can share 
intimate knowledge, such as licensing requirements or patent laws that will 
be needed. I think this application will be a great platform for like minded people
to post to forums with comments or suggestions to help others with their start 
up businesses. As I user I can preemptively post information that I find useful or
interesting for people embarking on the path of entrepreneurship. 

* I had a question for a project that I wanted to resolve. Using the keyword feature on Lightbulb I 
was able to sort through the questions/comments to find a similar question posted by a previous user.
The commenter answered that question and gave the information I needed. I found the answer to my
question without having to post on Lightbulb.
